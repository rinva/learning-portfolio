# Galaxy Training Network (GTN)

**Started:** June 2025  
**Focus Area:** Bioimage Analysis

Following the Galaxy Bioimage Analysis learning pathway to explore:

- Galaxy interface and workflows
- ImageJ and Fiji tools within Galaxy
- Deep learning for segmentation
- Napari, Cellpose, and ZeroCostDL4Mic integrations
- FAIR data concepts and metadata handling

This training supports my broader work in image-based data workflows, including preprocessing, segmentation, and reproducibility. I plan to document each tutorial as I complete it.
